# Project Title

[EasyShop] â€“ A React and Spring Boot Web Application

## Project Description

This is a full-stack web application built with a React.js frontend and a Spring Boot backend. The website allows users to register and log in, browse products, and make purchases(of course this is just a fake one). It features secure user authentication, a dynamic user interface, and a responsive design. The backend handles API requests, database interactions with MySQL, and user management, while the frontend provides a smooth and interactive user experience.
